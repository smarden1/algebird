/**
 * A QTree provides an approximate Map[Double,A:Monoid] suitable for range queries, quantile queries,
 * and combinations of these (for example, if you use a numeric A, you can derive the inter-quartile mean).
 *
 * It is loosely related to the Q-Digest data structure from http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~son/cs851/papers/ucsb.sensys04.pdf,
 * but using an immutable tree structure, and carrying a generalized sum (of type A) at each node instead of just a count.
 *
 * The basic idea is to keep a binary tree, where the root represents the entire range of the input keys,
 * and each child node represents either the lower or upper half of its parent's range. Ranges are constrained to be
 * dyadic intervals (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_(mathematics)#Dyadic_intervals) for ease of merging.
 *
 * To keep the size bounded, the total count carried by any sub-tree must be at least 1/(2^k) of the total
 * count at the root. Any sub-trees that do not meet this criteria have their children pruned and become leaves.
 * (It's important that they not be pruned away entirely, but that we keep a fringe of low-count leaves that can
 * gain weight over time and ultimately split again when warranted).
 *
 * Quantile and range queries both give hard upper and lower bounds; the true result will be somewhere in the range given.
 *
 * Keys must be >= 0.
